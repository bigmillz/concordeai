# PyInstaller bakes in whatever architecture built it, so the interpreter you
# run this with decides who can run the result:
#   x64 Python   -> x64 exe   : any normal PC, CUDA works. What a friend needs.
#   ARM64 Python -> ARM64 exe : Snapdragon/Surface/ARM VMs only, never CUDA.
# On an ARM box, an x64 Python runs fine under emulation and is the one to
# use for a shareable build. The script prefers x64 automatically when both
# are installed, and tells you which it picked.
#
# KEEP THIS FILE PURE ASCII. Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a .ps1 with no BOM
# as the ANSI codepage, not UTF-8. A UTF-8 em-dash arrives as three CP1252
# characters, the last of which is U+201D - a curly double quote, which
# PowerShell honours as a string delimiter. One dash in a comment silently
# desyncs the quoting for the rest of the file.
