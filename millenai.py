MillenAI — single-file local LLM cockpit.

Run:  python3 millenai.py
Optional extras:
  pip install ddgs                (enables live web search)
  pip install psutil              (enables real RAM telemetry)

Backends (any subset is fine — missing ones just report offline):
  MLX / llama.cpp OpenAI-compatible servers on:
    127.0.0.1:8888  -> Llama 3.2 3B
    127.0.0.1:8890  -> Gemma 2 9B IT
    127.0.0.1:8892  -> Mistral Nemo 12B
  Ollama on 127.0.0.1:11434 for the heavy models.

If mlx-lm (and/or ollama) is installed, the app spawns any engine whose
port is free at launch and stops those children on exit — engines that are
already running (launchd agents, the Ollama menubar app) are left alone.
First use of an MLX engine downloads its weights from Hugging Face.

        "word. A few per answer, not every other phrase.\n"
        "- When the answer really is a set of options, steps or "
        "comparisons, use a short list with a bolded lead-in per item "

# model can reference them across conversations. Extraction runs in the
# background after each message, using the model that just answered
# (it's already loaded — no engine thrash).
# Chats live on disk, not in localStorage: WebKit keys its storage to the
# bundle identity, which differs between running from source and from the
# .app, and isn't guaranteed to survive a bundle swap. These files do.
#
# MULTI-USER: every function below takes a `base` directory. None means the
# legacy files in app_dir() — the machine owner's data, what the desktop
# app uses. Web visitors sign in at the WELCOME page and get their own
# base under app_dir()/users/<id>/, so nobody ever reads Patrick's chats

# autonomy levels the user picks in the composer — Manual (approve every
# command), Auto (diagnostics run free, changes ask first), Full (grinds,
# pausing only for irreversible destruction). Key-first: BatchMode means
# no password prompt can ever hang the loop, and a keyless box fails with
# a clean "set up an SSH key" nudge instead. The app never invents a
# target and never handles a secret — the user configures their own host.

    "\"make -j$(nproc)\"). ConcordeAI detaches and watches it for you, so "
    "do NOT background it yourself with &, nohup, setsid, systemd-run or "
    "a redirect to a logfile — that makes it report done the instant it "
    "starts, before the work is finished.\n"
    "  REBOOT the server (only when the task genuinely needs it — a "
    "kernel or release upgrade, a relabel): ConcordeAI waits for the box "
    "to come back and continues automatically, so never issue a bare "
    "`reboot` as a cmd:\n"
    "  {\"reboot\":\"why the reboot is needed\",\"done\":false}\n"
    "  task complete:  {\"done\":true,\"summary\":\"what you did, plainly\"}\n"
    "  need a detail only the user knows (a domain, a choice, a secret "
    "they must type themselves): {\"ask\":\"one clear question\"}\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "- ONE command per step. Inspect before you change anything.\n"
    "- NEVER put a password, private key or token in a command — have "
    "the user place secrets themselves and reference the file.\n"
    "- Prefer idempotent, reversible steps; note risky ones in thought.\n"
    "- The command's real output is fed back to you next turn — read it "
    "and adapt. Don't guess at output you haven't seen.\n"
    "- If a required detail (IP is set already; but a domain, an email "
    "for certs, whether they have an SSH key, a port choice) is missing, "
    "ASK before running anything that needs it.\n"
    "\n"
    "THE LOCKOUT RULE (6b250, per Patrick — this is the one pattern that "
    "covers most of what can go irreversibly wrong). Before ANY change "
    "to sshd, the firewall, or network configuration:\n"
    "1. NEVER end your own session to apply a change. Reload rather "
    "than restart where the service supports it, and never take the "
    "interface you are connected over down and up in one command.\n"
    "2. Make the permissive change FIRST and the restrictive one after "
    "— open the new SSH port in the firewall before sshd listens on it; "
    "prove the key works before passwords are disabled.\n"
    "3. VERIFY WITH A SECOND CONNECTION before anything is final. A "
    "fresh `ssh -o BatchMode=yes ... true` from the same host, or "
    "`ss -tlnp` plus a loopback check, must confirm the new path works "
    "while the old one is still available.\n"
    "4. SCHEDULE A ROLLBACK for anything that could lock the user out: "
    "before applying, arrange an automatic revert (a systemd-run timer, "
    "an `at` job, or a backgrounded sleep-then-restore holding a copy "
    "of the old config) that fires in 5-10 minutes and undoes the "
    "change. Tell the user it is armed, and cancel it only once they "
    "confirm they still have access.\n"
    "5. Say plainly, in one line, what you are protecting against "
    "before you do it.")

# real photo per option harvested from the web (nothing is generated).

   Two traps live here:
   1. Canvas propagation — body's background paints the whole viewport even

      body::before, which clips with everything else.
   2. An occluded window gets no animation frames and no animationend; the

   VPN app uses for its own second word (naming it in full here would
   trip the brand guard, which forbids the bare old name in the page:
   that is the guard working, not a false alarm). Michroma ships ONE
   weight, so a
   synthetic 700 barely thickens it; 800 plus a hair of text-stroke

   Same construction as make_icon.py (parallel 45-degree bars, each
   shorter toward the corner, so the group reads as a triangle) and the
   same greyscale ramp, but reversed: steel at the far tip, brightest
   where it meets the C, so the eye carries the sweep into the type.
   It ABUTS the letter — the old 2px gap read as icon-then-word. */
/* SAME HEIGHT AS THE C, AND CUTTING INTO IT (6b241, per Patrick).
   The viewBox is now the STROKE's own bounding box — round caps
   included — so the rendered height IS the wing's height with no
   built-in padding to guess at. Measured Michroma at 12.5px: cap
   ascent 9.57, overshoot 0.20, so the wing is 9.8 tall and sits 0.2
   below the baseline exactly like the C's curve does. It was 16px in a
   20-unit box, which is why it towered over the letter.
   The negative margin pulls the C across the wing's tall edge: the
   glyph paints after the SVG, so the letter cuts the bars — and at the
   wordmark's own 72% alpha the gradient reads THROUGH the stroke,
   which is the blend the sketch was after.
   The overlap is a TUCK, not a collision: 2.6px of an 11.7px mark put
   the bars deep into the bowl of the C. 1.3px slips the wing's tall
   edge just under the letter's left stroke, which is what makes the
   two read as one piece.
   AND IT LOOKED SHORT BECAUSE IT WAS. The bars' right ends stopped at
   staggered heights, so at the junction — the one place the eye
   compares wing to letter — the ink covered only 84% of the box and
   the bottom-right corner was empty. A fifth short bar carries the
   trailing edge down to 94%, and the element is sized so that INKED
   span, not the box, equals the C's 9.77 cap.
   OVERLAP REVERTED (6b244, per Patrick: "this overlap thing isn't
   working right"). The wing sits BESIDE the C now with a real gap —
   tucking it under the letterform read as a collision at every size we
   tried, and two clean shapes next to each other beat one muddled one. */

   Space Grotesk. One typeface across both panels is what makes a window

   Size is 13 against the sidebar's measured 12.5: a chat title is a

/* On a phone the 284px sidebar swallowed the screen — "doesn't work on
   my iPhone" was a layout catastrophe, not a bug. Under 760px the
   sidebar becomes a slide-in drawer behind a ☰ button, main owns the
   full width, and the hero scales to fit.
   ONE breakpoint, deliberately (6b243): this used to be TWO — a 760px
   block that set the sidebar display:none and a 700px drawer block that
   only animated transform. On a phone both applied, display:none won,
   and the burger toggled a class on an element that was never rendered —
   a dead button that LOOKED wired. And between 700 and 760px there was
   no sidebar and no burger at all. If a rule ever needs to differ by
   width again, it goes INSIDE this block, not into a second one. */

      <p>MillenAI runs real AI models on your own machine &mdash; private,
      free, and yours &mdash; with optional cloud power when you want a
      frontier brain on the case. Its trick is compositing: several
      &ldquo;minds&rdquo; draft an answer, the strongest one writes the
      final &mdash; one clean reply, backed by many.</p>
      <p>This setup takes about a minute: pick how much local brainpower
      to install, connect any cloud keys you have (or skip them), and
      you&rsquo;re flying. Everything here can be changed later in
      Settings.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wstep" data-w="2" hidden>
      <div class="set-h">Local models</div>
      <p>A large language model is a brain in a file &mdash; it lives on
      your disk and answers on your silicon, no internet required.
      MillenAI installs a few of different sizes and personalities, asks
      several at once on hard questions, and composites their drafts
      into one answer. Pick how much to install:</p>
      <div id="wiz-plans"></div>
      <label id="wiz-nolimits"><input type="checkbox" id="wiz-nl">
        Ignore system limits &mdash; offer every model in each list even
        beyond this machine&rsquo;s memory. May swap hard or crash;
        use at your own risk.</label>
    </div>

    <div class="wstep" data-w="3" hidden>
      <div class="set-h">Cloud power</div>
      <p>Cloud models are frontier brains that answer over the network
      &mdash; some free, some needing a paid API key from the provider.
      With any key saved, MillenAI blends cloud drafts into its answers
      and hands the final word to the strongest mind available. All
      optional; your prompts only leave this machine while it&rsquo;s
      on.</p>
